<h2>Origin</h2>
<figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1336145-jack_kirby__the_origin_of_the_demon__page__005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1336145" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1336145-jack_kirby__the_origin_of_the_demon__page__005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1336145"><img src="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1336145-jack_kirby__the_origin_of_the_demon__page__005.jpg"></a><figcaption>Merlin &amp; Etrigan the Demon</figcaption></figure>
<p style="">
    There are two different origins for how Etrigan and Jason Blood became bound to each other. The original telling, which appeared in the Demon's first issue, showed that Jason and Etrigan were the same creature. Jason Blood was simply created by Merlin to act as a living prison for Etrigan and had no knowledge of his demonic half.
</p>
<figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/933785-demon_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-933785" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/933785-demon_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-933785"><img src="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/933785-demon_1.jpg"></a></figure>
<p style="">
    The second origin had Jason Blood and Etrigan as two separate creatures living during the time of Arthur and his knights, the same time period as the original. Etrigan's role was the same as in his first appearance, a servant of Merlin's summoned to help defend Camelot, and Jason was depicted as a Druid.
</p>
<p style="">
    Etrigan is the son of the arch-demon <a href="/belial/4005-30480/" data-ref-id="4005-30480">Belial</a> and another demon, Ran Va Daath. Merlin is his half-brother, as is <a href="/lord-scapegoat/4005-53418/" data-ref-id="4005-53418">Scapegoat</a> (they all share Belial as their father).
</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>
<p style="">
    Etrigan was created by <a href="../../jack-kirby/26-5614/" rel="nofollow">Jack Kirby</a> on September, 1972 in <a href="../../the-demon-the-origin-of-the-demon/37-12384/" rel="nofollow">The Demon #1</a>.
</p>
<h2>Distinguishing Characteristics</h2>
<p style="">
    Etrigan is a yellowish humanoid demon with fan-like ears and small horns on his forehead. He almost always speaks in rhyme. (This last characteristic was briefly dropped during John Byrne's <em>Blood of the Demon</em>.)
</p>
<p style="">
    Jason Blood is a normal human with a white streak that runs back through the middle of his hair.

<p style="">
    True to his nature, Etrigan is of two natures - human and demon. When he first was created he despised his life calling it a cures, but as time went on he found a sense of stability. This is why he is neither good nor evil he follows his own morals which guide him to save others. He has emerged as a hero who can be called in times of peril to fight injustice. When left to it's own devices, separated from Jason Blood, Etrigan is shown to be sadistic to an extreme, he murders humans without hesitation, and even has been shown biting an innocent bystanders arm off, This calls a lot of Etrigan's heroism into question, since it is clear he is only "good" if Jason Blood is influencing his actions.

<p style="">
    After Flashpoint Etrigan appears monthly as one of the main characters of Demon Knights. During the Siege of Camelot Merlin needs to hide the power of his bound demon Etrigan from the attackers who will soon overrun the castle. Jason Blood appears to warn Merlin of the attackers and is immediately chosen to host Etrigan. After the siege Jason meets the manipulative Madame Xanadu who builds a relationship with both Jason and Etrigan. Eventually the pair finds themselves in the path of the <a href="../../questing-queen/29-79992/" rel="nofollow">Questing Queen</a> along with a number of other adventurers; an exiled <a href="/exoristos/4005-79959/" data-ref-id="4005-79959">Amazon</a>, a young <a href="/sir-ystin/4005-33256/" data-ref-id="4005-33256">knight</a> on a quest, an arab inventor, later a lame horsewoman and <a href="/vandal-savage/4005-5722/" data-ref-id="4005-5722">Vandal Savage</a>. After the siege is turned back, the Demon Knights are invited to the mythical city of Alba Sarum, only to find Merlin murdered. Because of the wizards connection to most of them, they decide to journey to the island of Albion to find out who was behind the crime.

    In the present day of DC the armor Etrigan wears in Demon Knights has been seen stored in the Black Room under A.R.G.U.S. and Madam Xanadu is currently associated with the Justice League Dark, though she is weary of a certain <a href="/john-constantine/4005-3329/" data-ref-id="4005-3329">Brit</a> who has been put in charge of the group.

<p style="">
    Etrigan makes his modern day début in Stormwatch #13 where it is revealed that he sometime in the past was put into a magical sleep before being buried somewhere under the modern day London metropolitan area. An apartment building called the Malory House is later constructed directly on top of the sleeping Etrigan and has over the years acquired a sinister reputation, being the home of several serial killers, a place of strange sightings and disappearances and where tenants often loose their minds, all thanks to the dreaming demon beneath them. Whenever by design or chance, Etrigan's dreaming mind finally breaks into the mind of a deranged boy and has him called forth, resulting in the collapse of Malory House and the immediate confrontation between Etrigan, the <a href="/midnighter/4005-2196/" data-ref-id="4005-2196">Midnighter</a> and <a href="/apollo/4005-2197/" data-ref-id="4005-2197">Apollo</a>. Despite the lethargy from his long sleep, Etrigan still manages to dispatch Midnighter with just a casual swipe of his hand.

<p style="">Jason Blood was at his Gotham Penthouse when he felt a disturbance in the balance between Heaven and Hell. He immediately transforms into Etrigan and begins to track down this supernatural threat that is lurking in the dank alleys of <a href="/gotham-city/4020-23611/" data-ref-id="4020-23611">Gotham City.</a> Etrigan finally comes across a group of vagrants who proclaim some demon has been picking off their fellow indigents.

<p style="">Ragman has become possessed by <a href="/lady-blaze/4005-13675/" data-ref-id="4005-13675">Blaze</a> because she wants to see if Etrigan is worthy of returning to Hell as her consort. The battle between these demonic forces ends in the sewers because Blaze intervenes. Blaze tells Etrigan that she is pleased with his performance and she offers him the chance to regain his hellish status in the underworld. Without hesitation, Etrigan agrees to Blaze's request even though Jason pleaded with Etrigan in not accepting Blaze's proposal.</p>
<h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>
<h3>"The Rhyme"</h3>
<p style="">The transformation spell has varied over the years. The full texts follow, but generally the rhyme to transform him from Jason Blood to Etrigan is shortened to "Gone, Gone the form of Man! Arise the Demon, Etrigan!" The rhyme to return him to Jason Blood is "Gone now, O Etrigan, and rise again the form of man!"</p>
<p style="">John Byrne changed it during <em>Blood of the Demon</em> so that Jason generally transformed to Etrigan simply after hearing "Yarva Etrigan Demonicus," or even simply "Demonicus." He transformed back to Jason after hearing "Leave, leave, Etrigan, Fade O Demon, return the man!"</p>
<p style="">Jason and Etrigan can say it themselves, but they don't need to. Anyone can say it within earshot and they will transform.</p>
